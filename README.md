## Features
1. Search bar for recipes. I chose to implement this feature so users could  easily find recipes based on their preferences. 

2. Navbar for categories of recipes. I chose to implement this feature for additional preference selection as well as for users with intollerances. Having the option at the top of the page allows for easier usability.

3. Grid display with pictures of recipes. I chose to implement this feature for an appealing look and to display more recipes in a smaller area. As a user myself I enjoy being able to see a picture of a recipe before I decide on it. 

4. Nutrition label widget. I chose to implement this feature for users who may be interested in knowing the nutritional value of a recipe. 

5. Shopping list add and remove items. I chose to implement this feature so users could have the ability to create a shopping list in the same place they are browsing for recipes. Saving the list in local storage allows users to go shopping and remove items from the list as they pick them up or as they purchase them. 

6. Jokes feature. I decided to add this feature as a fun addition to an often mundane activity for those who do not enjoying shopping and cooking.


## Tests
    Run in the front and backend using `npm test` 

## Technology Stack 
```The front end was built using React. The backend was built using Node.js and PostgreSQL was used for the database.```

## Website desciption
```Evolution Recipe Planning allows visitors to browse through recipes generally as well as based on categories or specific search. Visitors can then view specific breakdowns of each individual recipe including description, instructions, ingredients, and nutrition facts. Visitors can also create a shopping list that saves in local storage so they are able to add and remove as they shop. Lastly visitors can browse through food jokes.``` 

## User flow
```Users start on the homepage which provides links to recipes, shopping list, and jokes. From the recipes link users will see a page with a large group of recipes. This page also includes a search bar and links to gluten free recipes, dairy free recipes, breakfast recipes, and main course recipes. Once a recipe is chosen and clicked on it will display a detailed breakdown of that recipe. Returning to the homepage when users visit the shopping list page they will see a place to add to the shopping list and once an item is added it provides the option to remove it for example after a user has purchased this item. Lastly returning to the homepage and following the link to the jokes page users will see one joke displayed at a time and a button that allows clicking through different food jokes.```
